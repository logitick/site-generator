I keep forgetting how to do this. Now, Iâ€™m writing down because the internet
never forgets.  Unless, of course, you have it in a production database with no
backups. Not having backups guarantees that your data will disappear into the
void.

If you've been given a bunch of `crt` files here a the steps to add them to
kubernetes.

<!--more-->


## Bundle up the crt files

I don't like having too many certificates around. I like to keep them bundled
up in one file. If you've got the already bundled up Certificate Authority (CA)
certificates, It's your lucky day. You'll only need to concatenate you're domain's
certificate with your CA certificate bundle.

```
$ cat example.com.crt >> fullchain.pem
$ cat My_CA_Bundle.ca-bundle >> fullchain.pem
```

If you don't have the bundled CA certificates, you're going to have to
concatenate them yourself but you'll have to follow a specific order in order
to not break the chain.



Let's try and inspect the your domain's certificate.
```
$ openssl x509 -text -noout -in example.com.crt
```

It's going to spit out a lot of stuff but the important stuff in the first few lines

```
Certificate:
    Data:
    	...
        Issuer: C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = Let's Encrypt Authority
    	...
        Subject: CN = example.com
    	...
```


The certificate issued for your domain always goes first. The next certificate
in the chain should have the `issuer` in the previous certificate as the
`subject`.

Basically, a valid full chain certificate should follow this pattern
```
Certificate:
    Data:
        Issuer: Issuer A
        Subject: CN = example.com

Certificate:
    Data:
        Issuer: Issuer B
        Subject: Issuer A
Certificate:
    Data:
        Issuer: ROOT Issuer
        Subject: Issuer B
Certificate:
    Data:
        Issuer: ROOT Issuer
        Subject: Issuer B
Certificate:
    Data:
        Issuer: ROOT Issuer
        Subject: ROOT Issuer
```

After concatenating your certificates into a single file it's now ready to be
used by your kubernetes ingress.



## Create a Kubernetes TLS secret
```
kubectl create secret tls www.example.com --key www_example_com.key --cert www.example.com.pem
```


## Use the TLS secret in the ingress
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: www.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: my-service
          servicePort: 80
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: my-service
          servicePort: 80
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - www.example.com
    - example.com
    secretName: www.example.com
```
