## My name is Paul Daniel Iway
#### Full-stack Developer / Devops Engineer @ [Suzerin](https://suzerin.com)

I've been developing web applications with PHP for about 6 years now and I work mostly in PHP but I am very open to learning new things. 

Not only can I make web applications, I can also help ensure smooth delivery to production environments by implementing a good delivery pipeline. I use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

At work I use Ansible for setting up our servers.

### Tech stack
**Languages:** Go, PHP, JavaScript  
**Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes  
**Database/Data Stores:** MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis  
**Tools:** Git, Gradle, Composer, NPM  
**Operating Systems:** Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS
