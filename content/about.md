## My name is Paul Daniel Iway from the Philippines.

I've been developing web applications with PHP for about 5 years now and Im starting to write command line applications with Go recently. 

Not only can I write applications, I can also help ensure smooth delivery to production environments by implementing a good delivery pipeline. I use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
